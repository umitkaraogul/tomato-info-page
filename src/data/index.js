for various purposes. Heirloom tomatoes are
becoming increasingly popular, particularly
among home gardeners and organic producers,
since they tend to produce more interesting and
flavorful crops at the cost of disease resistance
and productivity. In 1973, Israeli scientists
developed the world's first long shelf-life
commercial tomato varieties.

Tomato varieties are roughly divided into
several categories, based mostly on shape and
size.`;

        carotene lycopene, one of the most powerful natural antioxidants. In
        some studies, lycopene, especially in cooked tomatoes, has been found to

        genetic variation in tomatoes and their wild relatives has given a
        genetic plethora of genes that produce lycopene, carotene, anthocyanin,
        and other antioxidants. Tomato varieties are available with double the
        normal vitamin C (Doublerich), 40 times normal vitamin A(97L97), high
        levels of anthocyanin (resulting in blue tomatoes), and two to four
        times the normal amount of lycopene (numerous available cultivars with
        the high crimson gene).`;
