export const varieties = `There are around 7500 tomato varieties grown
for various purposes. Heirloom tomatoes are
becoming increasingly popular, particularly
among home gardeners and organic producers,
since they tend to produce more interesting and
flavorful crops at the cost of disease resistance
and productivity. In 1973, Israeli scientists

Tomato varieties are roughly divided into
several categories, based mostly on shape and
size.`;
